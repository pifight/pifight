The Pi Fight back end is written in Elixir using the Phoenix web framework. The front end is a combination of HTML, Sass, and Javascript.

To work on the Pi Fight code you'll need to install:

- Elixir
- Sassc

On a Mac both of these can be installed easily with Homebrew.

Once the prerequisites are installed, launch the server with `mix phoenix.start`
